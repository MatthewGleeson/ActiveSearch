Efficient Nonmyopic Batch Active Search. NeurIPS 2018. https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7387-efficient-nonmyopic-batch-active-search


This code is partially based on Matlab code written by Roman Garnett and Shali Jiang, located at https://github.com/shalijiang/efficient_nonmyopic_active_search

# How to use
Download the code and run 

`>> python3 scriptToRun` 

in the root folder to see a demonstration. 

Change parameter settings to try different datasets and policies. 

The code is partially tested on MacOS High Sierra 10.13.6 with Python 3.6.0.
